# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

>The process of applying programming knowledge to solve real world problems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

>Traditional programming focuses solely on coding but software engineering utilizes coding to solve real life problems

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

 a)Planning; Involves identifying the objectives of the software
 b)Analysis; Involves gathering requirements from stakeholders
 c)Design; Involves creating detailed design documents to outline system componenets
 d)Coding; Involves writing code in relation to the design specifications
 e)Testing; Involves making sure that the system works
 f)Deployment; Involves uploading software to an environment where it can be accessed by end users
 g)Maintenance; Involves providing support to ensure that all issues are fixed 


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

DIFFERENCES;
1.In the agile method there is continous feedback from  users while in the waterfall method there is limited customer involvment
2.In the agile there is flexibility while in the waterfall method changes are difficult and costly
3.In the agile method, testing occurs during the developmental phases while in the waterfall method testing only occurs once a phase is complete

Applications;
>Agile method is best prefferd for startups with uncertain and evolving requirements where customer feedback is crucial
>Waterfall method is best prefferd for projects with well defined requirements and a low likelyhood of change
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

>Requirements engineering is the process od defining and maintaining requirements for a software system to ensure that it meets stakeholders needs


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

>Modularity involves breaking down a system into smaller independent modules that each perform a specific function.
 This improves maintainability because independent modules can be updated without affecting the entire system
 It improves scalability as new features can be added without affecting the existing ones


Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

1.Unit testing; Involves testing individual components to ensure that they function corectly
2.Intergrations testing; Involes veryfing that combined modules interact as expected
3.System testing; Involves evaluating system performance against its requirements
4.Acceptance testing; Involes confirming that the software meets user needs

>IMPORTANCE
It ensures that the software meets user expectations
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

>Version control systems are tools used to manage source code overtime,enable collaboration and track revisions. They are essential for managing code in team environments and maintaining project history

>A popular example is GIT.


Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

>A software manager oversees planning, execution, and delivery of software projects, ensuring they meet requirements, deadlines and budgets

KEY RESPONSIBILITY;
Communicating with stakeholders to align project goals and align expectations

MAIN CHALLANGE;
Balancing scope, time and resources to deliver quality software

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

>Software maintenance involves updating a software after developmet to ensure its efficiency

>TYPES OF MAINTENANCE;
1.Perfective; Enhancing performance
2.Preventive; Making changes to prevent future problems
3.Adaptive; Updating software to work in new environments

>IMPORTANCE
It ensures that the software remains functional and relevant over time


Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

>ETHICAL ISSUES FACED
Privacy violations
Data security breaches

>To ensure ethical standards they should;
Follow professional codes
Prioritize privacy and data protection
